# Statistical-Analysis-Projects
Welcome to my repository for statistical analysis projects! This space showcases two different statistical tests implemented in Python, along with a focus on data visualization and clear interpretation of results.

Paired T-test on Iris Dataset
This Colab Notebook explores the classic Iris flower dataset. The main goal of this experiment is to perform a paired t-test to compare the mean sepal length and sepal width for the 'setosa' species. The notebook includes:

Data Loading and Preparation: Importing the Iris dataset and preparing it for analysis.

Data Visualization: Using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.

Hypothesis Testing: Conducting the paired t-test and interpreting the p-value to determine if there is a significant difference between the two variables.

One-Sample Z-test
The other notebook contains a practical example of how to perform a one-sample z-test. This is a statistical test used to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a known population mean when the population standard deviation is known.

Z-score Calculation: Calculating the z-score to measure how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean.

P-value Determination: Finding the p-value associated with the z-score.

Conclusion: Drawing a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the p-value.

Happy coding! âœ¨
